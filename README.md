# To Do App on Command Line Interface

It is a generic To Do App which runs from terminal. It is prepared for Chainlink Turkiye Meetup. The comments are belongs to me, so if any problem you see, warn me! 

To run it call like these 3 commands:

- cargo run "add" "work smarter"
- cargo run "start" "work smarter"
- cargo run "done" "work smarter"

There are 3 actions: "add","start","done". After writing your action, you must write your task for your todo list.

For this basic project, I benefit from the Rust book by Kumar and any open sources.
